# 📊 Student Performance Analysis in Mathematics

Welcome! I'm a mathematics teacher with a passion for data analytics and educational insight. This project is a collection of analyses I’ve done on student performance, with the goal of improving teaching strategies and student outcomes.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Analyze students' performance based on classroom data.
- Identify trends, strengths, and areas for improvement.
- Visualize the data using charts and dashboards.
- Demonstrate skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and reporting.

## 🗂️ Structure

- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for reusable code.
- `visuals/`: Graphs and figures generated from analysis.
- `reports/`: Summary reports in PDF format.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- PDF reporting (e.g., Jupyter, Word or LaTeX)
- Git & GitHub
